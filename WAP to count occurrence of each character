# Step-by-Step Explanation

# 1. Function Definition
# compress_string(s) takes a string s as input.

# 2. Counting Characters
# d = {} initializes an empty dictionary to store character counts.

# The for c in s: loop iterates over each character c in the string.

# If c is already in the dictionary, its count is incremented by 1.

# If c is not in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1.

# After this loop, d contains each unique character as a key, and its value is the number of times it appears in s.

# 3. Building the Result String
# result = "" initializes an empty string to build the compressed result.

# The for k, v in d.items(): loop iterates over each character (k) and its count (v) in the dictionary.

# For each character, it appends the character (k) and its count (v) to the result string.

def compress_string(s):
    d = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in d:
            d[c] += 1
        else:
            d[c] = 1
    result = ""
    for k, v in d.items():
        result += str(k) + str(v)
    return result

print(compress_string("aabbbc"))

Output: a2b3c1
